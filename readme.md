# TMUX

## Tmux Sessions

### How They Work (In My Own Words)
A tmux session is like a container, or a "box," where you can manage multiple terminal environments. This container is called a **window**. Inside a window, you can split the view into multiple **panes**, allowing you to work with different directories, instances of `nvim`, or shell commands simultaneously. Each pane acts as a separate terminal, giving you a powerful way to multitask.

## Essential Commands

### Tmux Prefix Key
`Ctrl + b`  
This key combination must be pressed before executing any tmux command.

### Create New Window
`c`  
Creates a new window and shows it in the status bar with its number and name.

### Rename a Window
`,`  
Renames the current window for easy identification.

### Switch to Next Window
`n`  
Switches to the next window in the session.

### Switch to a Specific Window by Number
`{number}`  
Press the number of the window (e.g., `1`, `2`, etc.) to switch directly to that window.

### Detach from a Session
`d`  
Detaches from the current session, allowing it to continue running in the background.

### Switch Between Sessions
`s`  
Opens a menu to navigate between different tmux sessions. Use `x` in this menu to kill a window.

## Advanced Tmux Shortcuts

### Split Window Horizontally
`%`  
Splits the current window into two panes side by side.

### Split Window Vertically
`"`  
Splits the current window into two panes stacked on top of each other.

### Toggle Between Last Two Windows
`l`  
Quickly switch back and forth between the last two windows you used.

### Resize Pane
`Ctrl + b` followed by arrow keys  
Use arrow keys after the prefix to resize the current pane in the desired direction.

### Kill Pane
`x`  
Closes the current pane.

### Kill Window
`&`  
Closes the current window and all its panes.

### Synchronize Panes
`:setw synchronize-panes on`  
When this is enabled, any command you type in one pane will be mirrored in all panes of the window. Disable it with `:setw synchronize-panes off`.

### Copy Mode
`[`  
Enter copy mode to scroll back through the buffer or select text. Use `q` to exit.

### Paste Buffer
`]`  
Paste the last copied text from the tmux buffer into the current pane.

## Customizing Tmux

### Change Prefix Key
If `Ctrl + b` is not comfortable, you can change it. For example, change it to `Ctrl + a` by adding this line to your `.tmux.conf` file:
```bash
set-option -g prefix C-a
unbind-key C-b
bind-key C-a send-prefix


- **Switch between sessions:** `s`
  - This will bring up a menu in which you can navigate between sessions
  - Inside this menu you can use just `x` to delete a window
